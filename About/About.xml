	<description>Are you tired of clicking 'Randomize' button until you get a pawn which you like? Do you feel burdened to customize pawns using 'EdB Prepare Carefully'? This mode will repeat clicking 'Randomize' button until you get the desired pawn. Just specify minimum skill levels, passions and incapacities to be excluded.

How to use?
1. In 'Create characters' Window, click the 'Filter' button next to the 'Randomize' button then, the filter window will be shown.
2. Set the filter options to specify minimum skill levels, passions and capacities required. Close the window.
3. Click the 'Randomize' button. The first pawn passing the filter will appear.
(This mode generates pawns up to 10000 times when the button is clicked. It can fail to find a pawn passing the filter in a single click so don't set too high level for skills or too many options)

Note
- It doesn't affect game in running or saved gamess.
- It might freeze the game for a short time if the maximum search limit is set to a high number.
- Warning: It might cause problems when used with other mods.</description>
